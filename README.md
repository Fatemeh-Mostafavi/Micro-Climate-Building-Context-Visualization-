# Micro-Climate-Building-Context-Visualization-
A pipeline for generating buildingsâ€™ environmental context maps using numerical simulation data

In this study, a pipeline of micro-climate building context visualization is proposed using Python programming language. The presented method is then applied to the Swiss Dwelling dataset v2.2.1 as the material for clarification of the pipeline. 

The pipeline code and samples of the generated maps can be found at this repository.
